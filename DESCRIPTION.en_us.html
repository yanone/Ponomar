    Ponomar is a contemporary Church Slavonic font that reproduces the typeface used in editions published by the
    Synodal Press of the Russian Orthodox Church in the early twentieth century. It is presently used in various
    liturgical books published by the Moscow Patriarchate. It also contains characters needed to typeset liturgical
    texts in Romanian (Moldovan) Cyrillic, Aleut, and Sakha (Yakut).
